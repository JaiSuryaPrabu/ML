# Machine Learning 🧠
---
> Machine learning is a type of _**AI**_ 🧠 that allows software to learn from the data and become more accurate in predicting outcomes without **human interventions** 👨‍🦱
### Machine learning is broadly classified into :
1. Supervised Learning 👀
2. Unsupervised Learning 🙈
3. Semi-Supervised Learning 👀🙈
4. Reinforcement Learning 🙈🙈

## Supervised Learning
---
> The supervised learning is a type of **ML** that learns from labeled data
* Supervised learning is used in:
    * Regression 📈
    * Classification 🐶🐱
### Regression 📈
> Regression is type of supervised learning that predicts the continous values.

The most common algorithms:

1. Linear Regression
2. SVR
3. Random Forest Regression

### Classification 🐶🐱
> Classification is type of supervised learning that predicts the discrete values (Yes or no). 

The most common algorithms: 
 
1. Logistic Regression
2. SVC
3. Random Forest Classifier

## Unsupervised Learning
> In unsupervised learning, the training data consists of a set of input vectors but no corresponding target values

### Clustering
> A way of grouping the data points into different clusters, consisting of similar data points.

The most common algorithms are:
1. K means Clustering
2. Hierarchical clustering
